# Gemini Context

This file serves as a context provider for the Gemini agent, summarizing the project requirements, the reference paper, and the repository structure.

## 1. Project Requirements (from `docs/PROIECT_FINAL.md`)

**Course:** Distributed Systems (2025)
**Goal:** Implement a distributed system project based on a selected paper.

### Deliverables:
1.  **Documentation (6p)**:
    *   Language: Romanian.
    *   Length: Minimum 5 pages.
    *   Structure:
        *   Introduction (context, problem description).
        *   Serial Algorithm Description.
        *   Distributed Algorithm Description (SPMD format).
        *   Theoretical Analysis:
            *   Correctness (1p).
            *   Time/Message Complexity (1p).
            *   Scalability (Advantages/Disadvantages with node variation) (0.5p).
            *   Topology Examples (1-2 examples) (1.5p).
2.  **Implementation (4p)**:
    *   Language: Any (Go is used in this repo).
    *   Goal: Support the theoretical analysis with specific problem tests.
    *   Requirement: Mini-demo during presentation.

## 2. Reference Paper (from `docs/KERBEROS_PAPER.md`)

**Title:** Kerberos: An Authentication Service for Open Network Systems
**Authors:** Jennifer G. Steiner, Clifford Neuman, Jeffrey I. Schiller (MIT Project Athena)

### Key Concepts:
*   **Goal:** Trusted third-party authentication for open networks where workstations are untrusted.
*   **Model:** Based on Needham and Schroeder model with timestamps to prevent replay attacks.
*   **Entities:**
    *   **Principal:** User or Service.
    *   **KDC (Key Distribution Center):** Trusted third party.
    *   **TGS (Ticket Granting Server):** Issues tickets for specific services.
*   **Artifacts:**
    *   **Ticket:** Encrypted credential for a specific server (contains session key, client ID, expiry).
    *   **Authenticator:** Proof of identity generated by client (contains client ID, timestamp), encrypted with session key.
*   **Protocol Flow:**
    1.  **AS Exchange:** Client authenticates to Auth Server (AS) -> Gets Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT).
    2.  **TGS Exchange:** Client uses TGT to request Service Ticket from TGS.
    3.  **CS Exchange:** Client uses Service Ticket to authenticate to Client Server (CS).
*   **Database:** Master/Slave replication for availability; `kadmin` for management.

## 3. Repository Structure

The project is implemented in **Go**.

*   `cmd/kdc`: Entry points for the Key Distribution Center (KDC) services.
    *   `setup`: Configuration and initialization.
    *   `start`: Server startup logic.
*   `internal/`: Core application logic.
    *   `protocol/`: Implements Kerberos protocol structs (Ticket, Authenticator, AS_REP, TGS_REP, etc.).
    *   `crypto/`: Encryption utilities (DES/AES, etc.).
    *   `kdb/`: Database interface and SQL queries (using `sqlc`).
    *   `kdc/`: KDC server logic (AS and TGS handlers).
    *   `ap/`: Application Protocol (client/server interaction).
    *   `server/`: HTTP/Net server boilerplate.
*   `docs/`: Documentation and LaTeX source files.
    *   `chapters/`: LaTeX chapters corresponding to the documentation requirements.

## 4. Current Status

*   **Documentation:** LaTeX structure exists in `docs/`.
*   **Implementation:** Basic KDC structure (AS/TGS), crypto, and protocol definitions are present in `internal/`.
